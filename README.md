# Median Rent Prediction for Studios, 1 Bedrooms and 3 Bedrooms+ in Astoria, Sunnyside and Greenpoint using Median Asking Rental Price from the Streeteasy Data Dashboard 

## Introduction:

Tons of people move to NYC everyday - and with a city so diverse with a lot of different neighborhoods and different standards of living, people tend to try out as much as they can while living in the city. The changes of one's environment is as fast paced as the city itself. You can go from having 8 roommates in a 5 bedroom apartment, get tired of them and move to a studio, meet a partner and then move to a 1 bedroom or get a new remote job that made you move to a 2 bedroom for a home office all within a short amount of time. This also applies to anyone out of the city planning to save money to finally chase their dreams in NYC while properly budgeting. So this project aims to help you plan your NYC life, which finding an apartment within your budget and preffered neighborhood is such an important factor.
